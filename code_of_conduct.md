# Workshops Code of Conduct

All attendees, mentors and volunteers at our workshops are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

*tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk*

### THE QUICK VERSION

Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of events participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any events venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Workshop participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organisers.

### THE LESS QUICK VERSION

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of workshop staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at workshop venues and workshops-related social events.
